Fast local mode removed ⚡

This repository previously supported a local "fast" benchmark mode (via `BENCH_FAST` or `BENCH_QUICK`). That mode has been removed to keep benchmark runs consistent and reproducible.

If you need faster local iteration, run a targeted subset of benches or add a short custom script to run only the benches you need.
