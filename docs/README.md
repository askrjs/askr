# Askr Documentation

Welcome — this folder contains living documentation for the key Askr APIs and patterns.

Files:

- `routing.md` — render-time `route()` accessor, route handlers, SSR/hydration notes, route examples.
- `data.md` — `data()` binding spec summary, examples, and common patterns (loading/error/refresh).
- `examples.md` — pragmatic conversions and examples (e.g., converting `TodoDetail` to `data()` pattern, using `context.signal`).

How to contribute:

- Keep examples minimal and correct against public API only.
- Prefer short code snippets and link to relevant tests.

This is just a start — add more as we go (testing, SSR, guides, migration notes, etc.).
