# Use GitHub Actions secrets (NPM_TOKEN) or GitHub OIDC (Trusted Publishing) for auth.
# See .github/workflows/publish.yml for CI auth steps.

# Use the public npm registry

# If your package is scoped and should be published publicly, either set publishConfig
# in package.json:
#   "publishConfig": { "access": "public" }
# or uncomment the scope-specific registry mapping below (no auth token here):
# @askrjs:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
