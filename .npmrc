# Repository npm configuration — DO NOT add auth tokens here.
# Use GitHub Actions secrets (NPM_TOKEN) or GitHub OIDC (Trusted Publishing) for auth.
# See .github/workflows/publish.yml for CI auth steps.

# Use the public npm registry
registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# If your package is scoped and should be published publicly, either set publishConfig
# in package.json:
#   "publishConfig": { "access": "public" }
# or uncomment the scope-specific registry mapping below (no auth token here):
@askrjs:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# === OIDC (Trusted Publishing) notes ===
# This repo prefers non-token-based publishing using GitHub OIDC (Trusted Publishing) and
# `actions/setup-node`. Keep the file free of long-lived tokens; the workflow will
# provision a short-lived auth token during the run and write it to the runner's npm
# configuration automatically.
#
# Recommended CI snippet (in .github/workflows/publish.yml):
#
# - name: Setup Node (for OIDC auth)
#   uses: actions/setup-node@v6
#   with:
#     node-version: 'lts/*'
#     registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org'
#     always-auth: true
#
# The job must also set permissions.id-token: write (already set in publish job) and
# have id-token permission at the job level for the OIDC exchange to succeed.
#
# If you need to fall back to token-based publishing during testing, write an
# npm auth line at runtime in your workflow (do NOT commit it):
# - run: echo "//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${{ secrets.NPM_TOKEN }}" > ~/.npmrc
#
# Keep tokens out of source control. Use OIDC for better security and no long-lived secrets.
